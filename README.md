# IBM-Used_Car_Price_Prediction_1
We will develop several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features.

Some questions we want to ask in this module
-do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?
-do I know if I put a fair value on my car?

Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression
Model Evaluation using Visualization
Polynomial Regression 
Pipelines
Measures for In-Sample Evaluation; R^2 / R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Decision Making

We conclude that the MLR model is the best model to be able to predict price.
